# Explanation
my goal here is to obtain the hyperparameters that are computed using gpflow. 

## Inside the notebooks
In each of the directories
	1. 1d_toy
	2. 2d_branin

I present a notebook where I extract the hyperparameters directly from the gpflow optimizer

## The toy problems
	1. just a 1d unconstrained function that I like to use
	2. the Branin function

## Major dependencies
	1. tensorflow -- version 1.0
	2. gpflow -- version 1.0
